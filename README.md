# DECENTRALIZED DIGITAL IDENTITY.  DIDs: Planetary Citizens

BITCOIN IDs on INTERNET = Planet Earth passports for EVERYONE.


# what i built?

1- new Blockchain on Polygon for a Global Planet Earth Digital Jurisdiction. INTERNET

2- worldwide institutionalized Wallet IDs (for people, nations, companies). BITCOIN

3- web Browser extension of the wallet and mobile for people to interact on the new Blockchain Global Digital Jurisdiction of Planet Earth = E-NET = The next generation of internet.


# Introduction:

Ethereum (Metamask) 

Bitcoin + (Nostr)  =  BITCOIN BANK ( aka INTERNET BANK )

We need to institutionalize digital IDs. for people, nations and companies to interact on the INTERNET. (global digital jurisdiction. LEGAL.



# PLANET EARTH DIGITAL IDENTITY. LEGAL


FIRST,

There is NO standard mechanism for issuance digital IDs.

Yes we have standards for physical assets: 

Passports depend on Aviation Regulations —> UN agreement.

But there is NO standard for issuing digital Passports.

To issue universal acceptance digital passports we need Digital Identifiers that individuals can OWN independently of any entity, organization or institution. DIDs.



SECOND,

We use Emails or Phones with different passwords to access websites and apps.

There are wallet addresses we use to exchange Cryptocurrency..... plenty of that. 
But there is not ONE Global wallet address that proves our Identity legal and as a global standard to interact on the INTERNET.

we need ONE and institutionalized. LEGAL. ( we will do on X )


# Let's take a look here:

Ethereum Blockchain uses Metamask wallet to access and sign transactions to exchange money, build apps, sign contracts, and interact with Ethereum Blockchain.

the plan is to land ETHEREUM on EARTH. (IDs for the entire humanity / Internet citizens). 

and the SOLUTION is BITCOIN and NOSTR ( the new INTERNET PROTOCOL ) for the social media / for the payment transactions

GLOBAL LEGAL WALLETS IDs for EVERYBODY. BITCOIN - NOSTR

* 1 person = 1 ID 
* 1 company = 1 ID 
* 1 Nation = 1 ID

we create new functionalities for 8 billion human beings to interact with the INTERNET. ( BITCOIN - NOSTR ) PROTOCOL

There is also no universal standard for expressing —> exchanging —> verifying —> credentials or IDs. ( BITCOIN - NOSTR ) PROTOCOL


# How it works….?

1 public key / 1 secret key. ( NOSTR PROTOCOL )

WE OWN our DATA

Private Key is secured by Biometric proof.

The uniquely paired public Key is published to a distributed Ledger.
everyone is in the sole control of their ID and DATA.
everyone makes decisions and signs contracts.

Digital ID is private, this puts you and everybody in sole control of your digital ID and DATA. You make the decisions.
Verifiable IDs, will make it easier to stay in control and help unlock more trustworthy internet and world. KEY to Rebuild Trust.

blockchain.com KEY to rebuild TRUST. worldwide.


# Summary:

We are doing a merge with Consensys 
We are in conversations with the UN to institutionalize internet Digital IDs for everybody

• Citizens 
• Nation-States
• Companies

We can not only track govt spending and contracts between Private and Public Sectors but also:

* Taxation
* Voting
* Border crossing
* Medical records

(Just to list some, also you can get a loan, purchase a house, marry, transfer a car......)



# KEY words:  INDIVIDUALS CONTROL , ENABLING TRUSTED 


# Sovereign Individual:


How identity and historical inertia affects people? 

This is a classic issue with “hyper systems” folks (people who think at the macro macro scale). 
They don’t think about people or identity! This is tough: systems are the opposite of individuals.
But we need to think about identity…


A digital identity wallet enables a user to establish relationships and interact with third parties in a trusted manner. 
While the wallet aspect is mainly dealing with key management, storage aspects and the graphical interface (UI = User Interface), the third party interactions are rather organised by your agent, which is a part of your wallet. 
Your agent handles third-party interactions in your name and acts in your interest. It is a piece of software, which helps you to stay in control of your messaging, security, health records, privacy, purchases etc.

Not all the wallets are the same….

A good comparison is a wallet for cryptocurrencies — think of an exchange like Coinbase or Binance. These companies offer you a hosted wallet, which you don’t control. You might have the authentication means (password + second factor) to access your wallet, but it’s not yours. In this case, you are the owner, but not the possessor and you don’t have data sovereignty. This is in stark contrast to so-called self-custody wallets, which you install on your device. These wallets randomly create a private key, which only you know. The key point is that your wallet creates keys for you, which only you know and not a third party.


A digital identity wallet, which follows the principles of SSI enables the user to have data sovereignty and complete control as well as data portability. It provides you with the necessary autonomy to be independent of a third party. It not only enables ownership but also possession. It enables transparency and explicit consent when sharing information. It’s also vendor-independent, meaning you can export your data and import it into another wallet of your choice since it is built on open standards, which are widely used. It also creates peer identifiers for every new contact or rather an interaction, instead of getting an identifier assigned to it.


Establish trusted relationships with third parties:
The wallet can create an encrypted communication channel to exchange information between you and a (trusted) third party. This communication channel is based on a unique identifier, which you control.

Store, organise and present verified data:
The user can store and manage (verified) credentials among other information within the wallet. Once in the wallet, credentials can be used to answer a proof request from every connection. The wallet creates a verifiable presentation, which the user can choose to send or instead decline the proof request.

A transparent history of shared data:
Since the wallet usually keeps a history of interactions, the user can track who shared what data and when. This leads to greater transparency for the user and helps to better exercise data protection rights. 



# Data integrity

Tampering which such public records can affect citizens, business and publics services…

By indexing the store data with hashes and put on the ledger we can prevent such tampering…. (Educate people to get the responsibility of their own data) —> REPUTATION.



# Benefits:

* Borders controls improve…
* Efficient Taxation…


# Also can prevent:

* Fake news
* Campaign disinformation
* Hacking database
* Hacking the voting software


# all of Us have to take our power and exercise it with the utmost responsibility.


# Blockchain serves for:

* Voting 
* Tax systems
* Security Services
* Issuing documents
